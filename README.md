#### Donation

While I actually didn't want to accept donations, more and more people are asking to donate so... I don't know, if you really feel like donating then I obviously highly appreciate it but **PLEASE** never feel forced to donate or anything. It won't change how we work on Noctalia, it's a project that we work on for fun in the end.
